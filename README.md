# Gram Staining Lab Report  
**Differentiation of Bacterial Species by Gram Stain Technique**

## Overview

This experiment demonstrates the use of the **Gram stain** technique to differentiate bacterial species based on the chemical composition of their cell walls. The Gram stain is a fundamental microbiological method used to distinguish between **Gram-positive** and **Gram-negative** bacteria by their ability to retain specific dyes.

By applying a sequence of staining steps, the experiment enables visualization of bacterial cell morphology and arrangement under a microscope, aiding classification of the organisms.

## Objective

To use the Gram staining technique to classify three bacterial species — *Staphylococcus aureus*, *Escherichia coli*, and *Bacillus subtilis* — as either Gram-positive or Gram-negative based on cell wall structure and staining outcome.

- Bunsen burner (for heat-fixing)  
- Nutrient agar cultures  
  - *Staphylococcus aureus*  
  - *Escherichia coli*  
  - *Bacillus subtilis*  
- Loop and distilled water  
- Gram staining reagents:  
  - Hucker’s Crystal Violet  
  - Gram’s Iodine Solution  
  - 95% Ethyl Alcohol (decolorizer)  
  - Safranin (counterstain)

## Procedure Summary

1. **Slide Preparation**
   - Cleaned the lab area and washed hands.
   - Prepared and labeled slides with bacterial samples suspended in water.
   - Air-dried and heat-fixed the samples.

2. **Staining Steps**
   - Applied **crystal violet** (1 min) → rinsed.
   - Applied **iodine** (1 min) → rinsed.
   - Used **ethyl alcohol** to decolorize (25 sec).
   - Applied **safranin** (30 sec) → rinsed and air-dried.

3. **Microscopic Observation**
   - Observed stained bacteria under a microscope.
   - Recorded cell morphology, color, and arrangements.

## Results Summary

| Bacterium              | Shape          | Color         | Gram Classification | Arrangement           |
|------------------------|----------------|---------------|----------------------|------------------------|
| *Bacillus subtilis*     | Rod-shaped     | Purple        | Gram-positive        | Single or in chains    |
| *Staphylococcus aureus*| Cocci (round)  | Purple        | Gram-positive        | Clusters (grape-like)  |
| *Escherichia coli*     | Rod-shaped     | Pink          | Gram-negative        | Single or diplobacilli |

## Discussion

The experiment confirmed that:
- **Gram-positive bacteria** (*S. aureus*, *B. subtilis*) retain the crystal violet stain and appear **purple** due to a thick peptidoglycan layer in their cell walls.
- **Gram-negative bacteria** (*E. coli*) lose the crystal violet after alcohol decolorization and take up safranin, appearing **pink** under the microscope.

Cell morphology and arrangement further helped to distinguish each species. Colony appearance on nutrient agar also supported microscopic observations.

## Conclusion

The Gram stain technique successfully differentiated bacterial species based on their cell wall properties. This method is an essential tool in microbiology for bacterial identification and classification. From this lab, the identification of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria was achieved visually, based on:
- **Coloration** (purple vs. pink)
- **Cell shape and arrangement**

This hands-on experiment provided foundational skills in microbiological staining and microscopy.
